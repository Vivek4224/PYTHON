What is the purpose continue statement in python?

Ans:-

The `continue` statement in Python is used to control the flow of loops. When `continue` is encountered inside a loop, it immediately skips the remaining code in that iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. 

Key Points:
- Purpose: To bypass the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.

- Usage: Commonly used in loops (`for` and `while`) to skip specific conditions and continue processing.
