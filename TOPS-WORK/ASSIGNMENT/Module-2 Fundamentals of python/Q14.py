What are negative indexes and why are they used?

Ans:

Negative indexes in Python provide a way to access elements in a sequence (like a list or string) starting from the end. Instead of counting from the beginning of the sequence, negative indexes count backward.

- `-1` refers to the last element.
- `-2` refers to the second-to-last element.
- `-3` refers to the third-to-last element, and so on.

Why Use Negative Indexes?

1. Ease of Access: They allow you to directly access elements at the end of a sequence without needing to calculate the length of the sequence.

2. Code Simplicity: Using negative indexes can make your code cleaner and more intuitive when dealing with the end of sequences.

3. Handling End Elements: They are useful for retrieving elements from the end, especially when you donâ€™t know the exact length of the sequence.

Overall, negative indexes offer a convenient and straightforward way to work with elements at the end of sequences.
